// Kaspa Wallet Standard — reference implementation.
//
// A PROPOSED standard (see SPEC.md) for how a Kaspa dApp and a Kaspa wallet find and talk to each other,
// with two parts:
//   • Part 1 — the provider interface a wallet exposes (accounts, network, signing).
//   • Part 2 — an EIP-6963-style discovery handshake so a dApp finds every present wallet with zero
//     per-wallet code, and any future wallet self-registers by dispatching one event.
//
// This package has ZERO runtime dependencies and is safe to import in Node (all browser access is guarded).
// The wire contract — the two event names and the existing fields below — is FROZEN: it never changes.
// Evolution happens only by adding new OPTIONAL fields. A wallet written against this file keeps working
// against every future version.

 * and MUST leave every other input untouched. Kaspa covenant transactions carry pre-authorized inputs
 * that must NOT be re-signed; a signature over an unlisted input, or over the wrong sighash, is a
